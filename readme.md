Plainly
===

I am pretty basic for a theme. Having not much in the way of fancy features, I like to step away, and let your writing speak for itself. I'm vaguely like that beloved old notebook you keep deep in the drawer. Sort of.

Plainly is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2014 Automattic, Inc. Stonehenge image in screenshot.png is from Charles Knight's "Old England: A Pictorial Museum", 1845.
